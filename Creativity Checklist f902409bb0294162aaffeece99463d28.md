# Creativity Checklist

Creativity is something that can be trained (1), in the same manner you can train yourself to improve your memory or become more patient. It’s also just as frustrating to train as these things, there’s no real metric one can use to gauge their creativity, and the world is full of the same sort of vague anecdotal advice on how to go about this training.

So I decided to add my own vague anecdotal advice to the pot!

These are tricks, tips, philosophies which have helped me creatively - especially in my writing, but I think the benefits extend to work and personal life as well - down to what you say and how you dress. My closet has never been so fabulous.

A lot of this advice I learned from *****************The Artist’s Way*****************, by Julia Cameron, which is sort of ***the*** seminal book on creativity. Full credit to her, go check the book out if you haven’t yet!

## Filtering Information

Every day we’re pummeled with gigabytes of data ranging from news, politics, opinion, music, celebrity crushes, kittens, etc etc etc. And we LOVE it. I once watched a 9 hour [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKgSMTON4fI) detailing the entire lore of the Bionicle universe. It was incredible.

Unfortunately that sort of information overload clogs up our minds. Absorbing a million and one pieces of information means the brain has a million and one things to think about. This raises two problems (which are sort of the same problem):

1. Creativity is, by one definition, pulling new ideas from nothing. The brain needs some *******nothing******* to start with. An overloaded brain doesn’t have the space, it needs to digest information first.
2. It’s difficult to think deeply about any one thing. Too much else demands our attention. Without attention, without focus, we struggle to fully understand a concept in a manner that allows us to examine it in a different light - to think about it in a new way - to scrape the bottom of the barrel for new insights.

Our brain needs some cognitive space to be flexible. Creativity is the mind stretching, finding new connections where there were none.

## Getting Comfortable with Nothing

An extension to the previous idea. One of the most effective ways to bump creativity is by just doing nothing. That’s it. ******************But I’ll be bored!****************** That’s the point. The brain gets creative to escape boredom. As a kid, if you were bored, you would play with a toy. There’s nothing else to do - children don’t have responsibilities on their mind, tweets to write, friends to text back. A blank slate means infinite possibilities. Ask a child about their toy and they can give you a wild, elaborate backstory on their toy complete with character development and exposition and conflict. 

I recognize this is easier said than done. Finding time to do nothing is challenging enough, actually sitting down and putting away distractions is harder. Spending time alone with your thoughts is out of the question. So, it’s easier to instead spend time with activities where you are not taking in new information and have minimal distraction. Some examples: drawing, painting, playing an instrument, cleaning the house, taking a bubble bath, dancing, etc etc etc etc. Let the mind wander.

## Resource Allocation

Think of creating like pulling from a pool of finite resources. You’ve gathered a catalog of experiences, sights, tastes, sounds, and you draw on them to produce something new. Draw on these resources enough and you may become drained. You may have produced something, but it’s more or less the same as what you’ve done before.

In order to form new insights, branch new connections, create something ***new***, you need to replenish this pool with novel sensations. It’s kind of a hedonistic pursuit. Creativity is a sensory experience. The best art reveals some truth to us, reflects life in a new - but relatable - way. So the more you see, the more you feel, the more you taste, the more you hear, the more you smell - the closer you will come to reality, to life.

I don’t even think these resources need be related to what you’re working on. As long as you have things to draw from, the mind can see them in a different light than first encountered.

## ***Fun*** Resource Allocation

This resource pool becomes especially effective when your catalog of experiences are things you love to do. An interest in trains can and should be indulged with whatever train-related paraphernalia you can get your hands on. The joy that comes from doing what you love - for some reason or another - makes it easier to produce creative work.

Maybe it’s easier to be as creative as a child, feeling happy as a child.

After having these experiences you walk away elated, turning the experience over and over again in your head, daydreaming about it, etching each sensation into your memory. Those are powerful resources to draw on creatively - you’ll likely remember a particular smell or sight from the event as more vivid, more emotional than other memories, and it’s not hard to incorporate that into whatever creative project you are working on.

The caveat here is that you are required to do something fun! We’ve trained ourselves to be frugal and conservative with ourselves - a good survival strategy - but creative work, I think, requires impractical, nonsensical indulgence. Creativity has never been responsible, nor made sense. The more elaborate the scheme, the better the story. This is something I’ve had to force myself to do consciously, and will resist in the moment, but never regret. It’s different for everyone, but will just be whatever brings you joy or you find interesting. For some people - a new comic book. For others - clothes, to replace their ugly tattered sweater they keep wearing. Little gifts from yourself to yourself deepen your resource pool and can be drawn on to produce new insights.

## Don’t Take It Too Seriously!

Creativity should not feel like work. Specifically: there might be a great deal of work required to package and ship your creative project - like marketing, eyeing distribution, negotiating contract - but actually working on the creative project should be a little joy you actively look forward to. Treat your project like play - time for you to spend with yourself, doing what you want, and the result is what it is.

When creativity does feel like work, it’s very easy to wrap up your project in a wet blanket. A lot of very adult things start happening like *discussing* ************requirements************ and ********************setting expectations********************. This has a habit of limiting your field of view and placing your project in very neatly defined boundaries. Again - creativity should not be practical. If this happens, it’s best to take a step back and consider if there is another path.

This is a checklist as much for myself as for anyone who might read it. I don’t mean to preach, think of it as listening to me ramble to myself. If one did read it - I hope you found this helpful, and remember not to take it seriously :)
