How can we cultivate empathy?

I played with a few opening lines here which more or less reduced to “here is why empathy is a good thing” (I don’t think anyone actually needs to be convinced of this) or “this is what you gain in being an empathetic person”, which really does not seem like an empathetic way to approach this topic. Nevertheless I think the benefits are worth discussing since many are not obvious - follows below.
