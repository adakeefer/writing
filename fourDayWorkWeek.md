# In defense of the 4-day work week

**TL;DR - The four (and a half) day work week has been a game-changer at my current role, and I sincerely hope more employers try it out. Time for your responsibilities, self-care, and dreams are all tough to find - an extra day, or a half, allows for you to be entirely present at work and brings a great deal more job satisfaction.**

I decided to discuss this after thinking a bit about work and mental health. A lot of people are unhappy in their jobs - for a variety of reasons - and I think one of the main drivers here is that a typical job can simply demand too much time from a person. There’s a distinction here between those who live to work (LTW), and those who work to live (WTL) - I’ll focus on the latter since that seems to be the overwhelming majority of my friends and my generation (1), but I think the discussion can just as easily apply to the former. Those who work to live see a separation between their work and their life, see their job as a means to an end, want to work to empower themselves to live independent lives and maybe fulfill some dreams along the way. A fulfilling life is, I think, one that follows that dream→chase→achieve→dream path. It’s how we grow.

However for WTL people, a job has a nasty habit of stepping outside those neat little boundaries we set around it between 9am and 5pm (2). When this happens, it’s very often that pursuit of dreams that is set aside for the immediate, and seemingly urgent. A missed phone call, a P0 bug fix, a demanding on call rotation - these things tend to take the place of time with yourself spent reading, writing, drawing, learning. When this becomes a chronic issue there’s a deep disillusionment I think many people begin to feel with life, as they feel they give so much towards work without ever being able to pursue their true passions. 

Even if work can be contained to a 40-hour week, a work week piles up a lot of errands nearly no one has time to do - and if they do, lots are running them on the company clock. I have no children and live in the city where everything is walking distance. I have about enough time to shave, some mornings. There are really moms out there driving children 20 minutes each way to soccer practice while working a full time job, never mind if you need to make dinner. Spending your free time, your weekends doing chores and expecting to come back to work at your full potential every week is a great way to build resentment at… lots of things.

Finally it’s important to recognize the paradigm of 40hr work weeks is a fine one, but the type and quality of work you are doing can throw that out the window. A week of heads down debugging work != A week of design and product discussions. Expectations need to be managed and no one really knows how well someone will handle a style of work except you and yourself.

Seems dark. What can we do for these poor WTL-ers?

## Enter: The four-day work week

I’m going to preface this with the following: I am not an economist, nor a labor scientist, nor a business owner. I’m ignorant of all the administrative complexities of managing a workforce or a business, and I’m speaking only to my perspective as an employee that likes to get shit done.

The four-day work week is a concept you can raise to our WTL friends and they start salivating. People are enchanted with the idea. It’s not hard to imagine why. For a WTL person running 50-60 hour weeks, trying to stay fit, attempting to date, sneaking in a coffee with a friend here and there, *****maybe***** getting 8 hours of sleep… an extra day to themselves each week just about sums up heaven. I’ll try to touch on the arguments here anyways:

1. ********************************************************************A time to address responsibilities******************************************************************** - This is what I call the “Errand block”. You use the extra day to batch together all your miscellaneous responsibilities that spontaneously generate throughout the week. Mom needs your travel plans now? Book that Christmas flight. Your girlfriend doesn’t remember what you look like? Plan a date with her. Forgot to feed yourself this week? Grocery run. An abridged work week acknowledges that life happens, people have responsibilities, and provides employees the flexibility they need to be entirely present at work. Nobody wants to be submitting insurance claims in the office.
2. **************************************************************A time entirely for yourself -************************************************************** At my current company, we work only 9am-1pm on Friday, every Friday. It’s a phenomenal benefit. You are presented with a block of time, from 1pm-5pm, in which the world is at work but you are not. What a treat! No crowded subway cars, no lines at the kebab shop, entire stores where employees cater to you alone, a shady grove to yourself (3)… you feel like a kid in a candy shop when everything is about ***you***. Most people recognize the value of taking time for yourself - but how often does one use that time to do things ****they**** want to do? “Time for yourself” usually turns into “Time to take care of Lacy’s dog for the tenth time” and not “Time to play my tambourine(4)”. A block of time in which ***you*** have no other obligation other than ********yourself******** is one of the greatest benefits an employer can offer.
3. ********************Increased job satisfaction -******************** Remember all that esoteric stuff I wrote about dreams at the beginning of this article? (5) Turns out if you get time to pursue them you’re a lot happier in your job, because you’re a lot happier in your life. Those feelings of resentment fade, and every Friday you inch a bit closer to that dream you’ve always had. It becomes easier to be present at work and it becomes easier to work harder at work.
4. **********************Increased job… productivity?? -********************** Microsoft Japan tried a [four-day work week](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/microsoft-japan-four-day-work-week-productivity) in 2019 and saw their productivity jump by nearly 40%. The results of the largest 4 day work week [pilot study](https://www.4dayweek.com/uk-pilot-results) to date have been released in the UK and while they did not see such drastic productivity increases, the did note an improvement in company performance and a substantial decrease in company absences/sick days. I believe this data just echos my points above - with time for external responsibilities and time for self, an employee is more present, more happy, and ultimately more productive at work.

## A note on work-life balance abuse

With more and more pilot studies reporting fabulous results in worker productivity, happiness, and performance, there are a lot of companies out there now who believe in personal days, the four day work week, and a greater balance between work and life. I also think there are a lot of people out there who are eager to abuse these perks. A large company with unlimited PTO can pretty easily have workers who come in and cruise. So the challenge becomes, as a large company, how do you ensure your workers get the time they need without becoming apathetic?

A large portion of this is screening, not just for technical skills but for MOSTLY attributes like conscientiousness, a sense of responsibility, a desire to build, a desire to make something out of themselves. I believe these can be detected in interviews and SHOULD be searched for, much more so than technical skills. (6)

The next portion is building a culture - not one where everyone is accountable, but where everyone cares about and values their work. You can screen for the perfect candidate but dropping them into an environment of apathy will crush their desire to be better. An office presence is great, and I think necessary to have people actually engaged in their company, but nothing spreads apathy worse than a neighbor who has already checked out.

After that though, I’m not sure what else can be done to prevent workers from taking advantage in these scenarios. I do think people are naturally predisposed to want to perform their job function as well as possible - coasting feels bad - and I do think the four day work week is a safe way for a company to grant their employees a better life balance without sacrificing much, or any performance - but let the data speak for itself here, not just me.

There is one more caveat here, which is that employees who get the four day work week pretty quickly cannot imagine life without it. From that same pilot study [above](https://www.4dayweek.com/uk-pilot-results) something crazy like 60% of employees said they would not even consider a job that did not offer a four day work week after experiencing it firsthand. So, no “test runs” for an organization - you either commit to it or you risk losing more people than you keep. Your employees have tasted the kool-aid.

(1) There are many reasons why this might be, I think two main drivers are economic inequality (everyone funneled towards the same 3% of jobs that make 25% of profits) and the dominance of STEM fields in higher education (Students are pressured to choose the best-performing (and highest funded) fields of education - not necessarily what they want to do).

(2) Though I’m of the opinion that this is an artificial timeframe anyways - work should occur when you work best.

(3) These blocks of time where the world works remind me of NYC during the pandemic. Greenwich was a liminal space. You just stare down empty streets, running into the horizon, and your mind clears. No worries, no anxiety - just the present. If you understand that feeling, you’ll grasp how much I look forward to these Friday afternoons. It’s a little slice of peace.

(4) How many noises can you really make with a Tambourine? Two?

(5) It’s ok if you skipped it :)

(6) My purely anecdotal advice on technical skills -

In my opinion these are something you concentrate on when a candidate comes from a relatively unknown background. If you’re chatting with a FAANG candidate, or a Michigan grad (go blue!), you can be reasonably confident they are competent coders and can spend more of your time discussing values, project management skills, cooperation with teammates, etc. Google disputes this - the coding interview seems to be their greatest metric of performance as a software engineer - and I am not one to argue with 15+ years of hiring data - but what works for Google, at Google, by no means translates everywhere.

If you’re not familiar with a candidate’s background, however, or they have little experience, you want to lean a bit more into screening. I have had more than one case where I spent an unreasonable amount of time teaching a new hire how to use a debugger - I’m an enormous proponent of mentorship, but there needs to be a common foundation of understanding among a team. Otherwise a great deal of developer time (and ultimately money) is wasted when a greater investment of both in a more experienced engineer could yield a better outcome.

This topic sort of cascades into an immense discussion on how to interview an engineering candidate… I’ll omit it, for now.
