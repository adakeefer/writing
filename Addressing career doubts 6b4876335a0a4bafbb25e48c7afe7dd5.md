# Addressing career doubts

Over the course of 2022 I sank a considerable amount of time into really refining what I want to do in my life, my dreams, where I want to see myself in ten years. I see my peers running a mass exodus from oh-my-god-i-hate-this-job to my-slightly-different-job-with-the-same-title-is-a-dream. How much would that change? Would that really bring my friends to a different place in a few years than they are now? Many come to the realization that they could just continue on their current path without too much resistance, and that’s an alarming thought. It’s easy to coast, but that never catalyzes growth.

I recruited again in the fall of 2021, and after several rounds of interviews was rejected from my dream job for the second time. That made me take a step back and reevaluate where I was at and what I wanted from life. Did I really want to be a software engineer in 10, 20 years? Did I want to go from i-hate-this-job to slightly-different-dream-job? So I sank my teeth into a few schemes I’d been tossing around for the past however-many years. 

If not now - when? In 5 years I could be married, or have a child. Momentum starts to take over and it becomes more and more difficult to break out of your current life path. If I could be better at my profession, do something closer to my dreams, be more creative in my day-to-day routine, I want to explore that possibility. I tried out instruments, drawing, design, writing, but the two I really pursued during this time were entrepreneurship and music production.

## Alternative paths

I pursued Entrepreneurship for the wrong reasons I think. I came in wanting something I could build in my free time, set up, hire a bunch of people to automate, and cruise. Not because I truly wanted the joy of making something, but because it would enable me to do other things. By virtue of automation I could free my time and separate myself from a desk in order to spend my time learning, traveling, writing, spending time with the people I love. I never wanted a fortune 500 business, but I would dream about the lifestyle it would enable through saving an astounding amount of my time.

I thought I knew what I was doing - I’d tried to learn how to build a business for years - but I found entrepreneurship to be totally infeasible.  Iterating through hundreds of ideas, market sizing and evaluating product feasibility for each, hitting a wall. I left each day feeling frustrated and burnt out, confused that my *overwhelming genius* couldn’t produce several million dollar ideas, stressed that my work was going towards nothing.

On the other end of the spectrum I wanted to make music - not because I thought it would make me any money, but because music and musicians are near and dear to my heart. I don’t think I’m skilled enough to play in a band, but electronic music production has become so accessible to anyone with interest and a computer over the last 10 years. We’ve recently seen an explosion in talented DJ’s and ambient artists (7) who, when asked about their success, will tell you they literally just sit in their basement with their laptop and a MIDI controller and experiment. So why couldn’t I?

I dove into Ableton, played with my own MIDI keyboard, learned compressors and equalizers and LFOs. And when I sat down to make the music, it was not fun. I had plenty of ideas - but actually translating them into reality seemed impossible. With tens of thousands of sounds and millions of ways to alter each sound, how do you find what you hear in your head? What a dull and monotonous process of trial and error. Why did I dislike what I was doing if I loved music so much?

## Back to engineering - and why

I came back to engineering. Certainly feeling like I’d thrown in the towel and resigned myself to it. But in coming back to it a strange thing happened. I started to enjoy the field more than ever. I began spending my free time researching, learning as much as I could. I started building personal projects - I’d never done that before, Adam of 2021 would ***not*** spend his free time doing what he did at work all day - and generally felt a… contentment with my field. Why?

Could be some cognitive dissonance-esque pop psychology phenomena. You weren’t able to achieve your goals, you convince yourself the fallback option was your goal all along. The ego comforting itself that things are going according to plan. The thought definitely bothered me so I sat down to write why I was on this career path in the first place.

First and foremost is the joy of building things. Software engineering is a superset of dev work. The dev work is what pulls most people into the field - I know this is true for me. Programming is an expression of creativity that one doesn’t get from most other jobs. Coding is an art - Donald Knuth wrote a whole multi-volume [work](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) on the aesthetics of code - and people continue to create similar compendiums to this [day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&themeRefresh=1). Allowing myself to create art in my day-to-day scratches some itch for me. On top of that art engineers can build complex systems which accomplish impossible tasks. It feels a privilege to have designed and produced one of these systems myself. Knowing I built something impressive, every time I see it work, I get a little hit of confidence.

The second is the joy of doing what you are good at. The joy of being useful. Knowing that you kicked ass at work today and you accomplished an important task feels ****good****. Conversely there is no better way to get yourself down than to feel useless. I believe people do innately want to work - but working on something that does not feel useful, that one is not skilled at, is a strong negative feedback loop. Not all days, but most days I leave work feeling somewhat accomplished and that is not a feeling I ever had in the other fields I pursued.

The third is the joy of learning. Software engineering is such a dense field and you can get really, really deep in the weeds if you so desire. Compilers come to mind. It always feels as though there is more to learn, which means you can always end the day smarter than when you started. That continuous self-improvement is a great incentive for me to continue where I am. There is an alternative argument that people should have as diverse a skill set as possible - but I don’t think these two viewpoints cannot coexist. Outside of work I can and do learn skills off the computer - writing, skiing, drawing - and inside of work I can deepen my skill set in one area. Breadth and depth, equally important.

I think the ultimate goal in your career is to grow as much as you can. If that isn’t happening at the job level, switch jobs. If that isn’t happening at the career level, switch careers. I think there’s so much more to be done and discovered within my discipline, so I’m sticking it out. I want to pursue grad school so I can learn to be more of a scientist as well as an engineer, I want to do research and be on the cutting edge, I want to see if there are ways to break out of the traditional SWE career mold and be something altogether different. It feels exciting to me, and that is more feedback that I am on the right track.

Fast forward a year and I still feel happy and confident in my career path, I think exactly because I took the time to address these little nagging thoughts, these dreams that just wouldn’t let go. I feel more confident I’m on the right path, that I’m not missing out on an alternative life I would love even more than this one.

I think a lot of people believe these highly desirable or allegedly more fulfilling careers like being a successful musician or an author are the result of hard work and a lot more think they are the result of innate talent.

I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle. You need the innate talent to cultivate love for the work - a musician has their inner ear, an author has a knack for slapping words together that sound acceptable - and from that talent and love you need to acquire that single-minded dedication to the craft which allows these people to hone their skills to success.

I found I had absolutely none of these qualities to be an entrepreneur, potentially one as a musician, and both as an engineer and scientist. That’s a pretty clear sign to me on what to pursue. I no longer feel like I missed the road less travelled; I started down the path, realized I was poorly equipped for the mission, backtracked to where I am now and doubled down.
