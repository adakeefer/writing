main takeaway: i want to pursue the intersection of art and code. theres a beauty in information and mathematics that can be modeled

important because this is an area where my interests collide

mandlebrot set - infinite complexity in simple rules

god its so pretty

these hidden shapes are all around us - we discovered them

computers can generate ANYTHING now

creating art in computers

donald knuth the art of programming

international c obfuscated code challenge

a quine - program that prints itself

an eternal golden braid

polyquine

oroborus quine

shakespeare programming language

chef programming language

creativity in one domain translates to another

sidebar: i really badly want to pursue grad school for stuff like this too
