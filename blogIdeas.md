1. ************************************Master list, the things that have developed me as an engineer************************************
2. **********************************************************************things that have helped as a creative**********************************************************************
3. **********************************************************************things that have helped as a person**********************************************************************
4. **In defense of the 4-day work week**
    1. 40-50 hour workweek not necessarily right - Different types of work
    2. time to take care of your errands - spending all weekend doing chores in order to go back to working is a recipe for disaster
        1. People need time with themselves, to quietly reflect. I recognize people won‚Äôt do that but still time to decompress is important.
        2. I don‚Äôt even have children but I rarely get to see my friends
    3. friday afternoons off
    4. footnote that people do tend to abuse this so there‚Äôs a larger discussion on how to screen for this kind of stuff and detect apathy
    5. Finally note that for organizations this might not be a realistic possibility and that people still need to put in the heavy lifting.
5. **writing - communication as an engineer - writing**
    1. engineers are notoriously bad at communication. i don‚Äôt think this is as bad as it used to be but certainly in the past we had our share of engineers who would sit down and grind and not look up.
    2. communication takes many forms
    3. writing is the one that is most frequently abused I think. transition to lots of async meetings
    4. writing should be as simple and clear as possible
        1. writing exists as an alternative to speech. what do we gain when we switch to writing, what do we lose?
        2. when we have a broad audience or simply don‚Äôt have time to go 1-1 with everyone, we need something that‚Äôs fast, easy to read, and gets the job across with minimal filler.
            1. footnote that this isn‚Äôt necessarily how i‚Äôm writing here. This is writing for pleasure, and it‚Äôs as much for me as it is for the reader here
        3. example of what writing should be, in bullet point content
    5. Tech jargon
        1. A measure of how well designed a system is, is how easily you can explain it to a non-technical person
            1. footer: is there such a thing anymore? especailly at tech companies, there‚Äôs  a certain level of literacy expected
        2. 
6. ********************Work and Creativity, a crisis of meaning********************
    1. I‚Äôm of the opinion that creating is one of the most fundamental things a person should do, everyone has a capacity for it and it has an astounding beneficial effect on one‚Äôs mental health.
    2. Lots of workplaces do not allow for creativity, at least in ways people wish to explore
        1. Even ‚Äòcreative‚Äô roles like designers are restricted by a set of parameters under which they can operate. In most orgs, these rules are there for a reason, and I don‚Äôt believe one should move against them because they‚Äôre needed, but it still leaves a need in one‚Äôs heart
    3. So people don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre doing what they‚Äôre supposed to be doing - people need outlets to express themselves and share ideas.
    4. People don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre doing what they want to be doing, or meant to do, or don‚Äôt care.
    5. Meaning comes from being useful and doing something you‚Äôre GOOD at.
    6. The more valued you are the better you feel about it
7. ************Grad School************? ************************************What are credentials at this point?************************************
    1. What even is the point of grad school?
    2. [educative.io](http://educative.io) - boom
    3. 
8. ********Haskell - nice stuff!********
    1. Look at how cool this function is.
    2. you can prove it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do
    3. want to do this? what about this? what about this? no.
9. **********************************************Vectorization in Python**********************************************
10. ******************************************************************Building a strong company culture******************************************************************
    1. Is this achievable - I don‚Äôt know - I haven‚Äôt been anywhere that this works for - but I want to try
11. **************My Productivity Cheat Sheet**************
    1. everything I know
    2. list:
        1. phone/notifications
        2. pomodoro vs big flow
        3. physical health
        4. sleep sleep sleep
        5. filter distractions
        6. Carbs
        7. Mental cycles and building an external brain
        8. time of day to do x work
        9. music?
        10. take a break üôÇ
        11. be nice to yourself! many small tasks better than one huge task and a long cooldown period
12. How to optimize your brain to produce content
    1. it‚Äôs about producing rather than consuming. how to balance?
13. fantasty worldbuildingüòé
14. Creativity checklist
    1. creativity is something that can be trained in the same manner you can train x. is it however equally frustrating
    2. we want to filter information input
    3. be comfortable with doing nothing. mind wandering is great
    4. treat yourself nicely. creativity also comes from doing things you want or what you are interested in
    5. its not supposed to feel like work - it should excite you
    6. i hope more people can try this out because i do genuinely believe it brings such happiness to people
15. list of curiosities
16. ‚Äú****************************************************Do you have any projects on your resume?‚Äù****************************************************
    1. This is one of this things that baffles my friends in any other field. Personal projects?
    2. The last thing most people want to do after giving 100% at work is to code.
        1. now depends - it‚Äôs a creative outlet - so I get it. people want to learn. I get it.
    3. How can companies resist?
        1. It‚Äôs something that just oozes appeal. **********************************************Look at my projects. I live and breathe code.********************************************** Honestly - why would you choose anything else?
        2. More and more people push themselves into spending their time making things they are not interested in because they believe they need these things to be hired - and they might.
        3. As a candidate - this takes a toll.
    4. Arguments against:
        1. potentially poor communication
        2. not a balanced individual
        3. company culture - is this something we want?
    5. A resume project need not be coding
        1. The expectation is that it is, because so many high performing engineers do this stuff
        2. here‚Äôs my theory - everyone has a personal project, few feel it worthy to list, few have it in coding
        3. for me - I want to write, so here i am.
