1. engineers are notoriously bad at communication. i don’t think this is as bad as it used to be but certainly in the past we had our share of engineers who would sit down and grind and not look up.
2. communication takes many forms
3. writing is the one that is most frequently abused I think. transition to lots of async meetings
4. writing should be as simple and clear as possible
    1. writing exists as an alternative to speech. what do we gain when we switch to writing, what do we lose?
    2. when we have a broad audience or simply don’t have time to go 1-1 with everyone, we need something that’s fast, easy to read, and gets the job across with minimal filler.
        1. footnote that this isn’t necessarily how i’m writing here. This is writing for pleasure, and it’s as much for me as it is for the reader here
    3. example of what writing should be, in bullet point content
5. Tech jargon
    1. A measure of how well designed a system is, is how easily you can explain it to a non-technical person
        1. footer: is there such a thing anymore? especailly at tech companies, there’s  a certain level of literacy expected
