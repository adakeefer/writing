# Why do we find ourselves Dream-Adjacent?

Over the last six months I sank a considerable amount of time into really refining what I want to do in my life, my dreams, where I want to see myself in ten years. At 25 I feel a quarter life crisis coming on and I don’t think I’m alone - my peers are running a mass exodus from whatever role they’re currently in. First jobs out of school grow stale, people start thinking about grad school, people I think start to realize some dissatisfaction with their current path. Many come to the realization that they could just continue on their current path without too much resistance, and that’s an alarming thought. It’s easy to coast, but that never gets us where we really want to be. People require resistance to grow.

I recruited again in the fall of 2022, and after several rounds of interviews was rejected from my dream job for the second time. That made me take a step back and reevaluate where I was at and what I wanted from life. Did I really want to be a software engineer in 10, 20 years? Was I ok doing that for the foreseeable future? I didn’t know (1). So I sank my teeth into a few dreams, ideas, schemes I’d been tossing around for the past however-many years. 

If not now - when? In 5 years I could be married, or have a child. Momentum starts to take over and it becomes more and more difficult to break out of your current life path (2). If I could be better at my profession, do something closer to my dreams, be more creative in my day-to-day routine, I want to explore that possibility. I tried out instruments, drawing, design (3) (4),but the two I really pursued were entrepreneurship and music production.

### Entrepreneurship

I pursued Entrepreneurship for the wrong reasons I think. I came in wanting something I could build in my free time, set up, hire a bunch of people to automate, and cruise. Not because I truly wanted the joy of making something, but because it would enable me to do other things. By virtue of automation I could free my time and separate myself from a desk in order to spend my time learning, traveling, writing, spending time with the people I love. I never wanted a fortune 500 business, but I would dream about the lifestyle it would enable through saving an astounding amount of my time.

Despite my literal years of research on the topic, I found entrepreneurship to be completely infeasible (5). You can see my list of ideas I tried here. All of which I practiced market sizing and product feasibility strategies for found here, with no success. I left each day feeling frustrated and burnt out, confused why I didn’t have a million dollar idea yet (6), stressed that my work was going towards nothing.

### Music

On the other end of the spectrum I wanted to make music - not because I thought it would make me any money, but because music and musicians are near and dear to my heart. I don’t think I’m skilled enough to play in a band, but electronic music production has become so accessible to anyone with interest and a computer over the last 10 years. We’ve recently seen an explosion in talented DJ’s and ambient artists (7) who, when asked about their success, will tell you they literally just sit in their basement with their laptop and a MIDI controller and experiment. So why couldn’t I?

I dove into Ableton, played with my own MIDI keyboard, learned compressors and equalizers and LFOs. And when I sat down to make the music, it was not fun. I had plenty of ideas - but actually translating them into reality seemed impossible. With tens of thousands of sounds and millions of ways to alter each sound, how do you find what you hear in your head? What a dull and monotonous process of trial and error. Why did I dislike what I was doing if I loved music so much?

How can you love a dream so much, but hate actually pursuing it?

I experimented with these two things for about five months. I left this period feeling demoralized

(footnotes)

(1) The short answer is yes. The long answer is explored in another blog post here: Taking a step back from SWE.

(2) Although many people dispute this. There are many nontraditional life paths gaining popularity out there and it’s much easier to career shift later in life than it was for our parents.

(3) And writing I suppose. But I was already doing that.

(4) I was also shockingly average at all of these things.

(5) A friend’s father told me after I tried all of this that the *****young***** people starting successful businesses are neurotic geniuses, and unless you consider yourself the same you’re better off learning and growing in your career. I’m no genius.

(6) Unrealistic expectations, you say?

(7) I’m listening to [Shingo Nakamura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYp9Eo9T3BA) and [Mount Shrine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI1ZGL0J0vk&t=8291s) at the moment. Also lots of synthwave - I like [oDDling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xVHpgJbuc8)
