This is a compilation of books which are hugely influential in my life. The criteria I like to use here is, at a minimum, does the work make me think about it after I finish it? Do I come back to the work, wanting to experience it again? Does it change my point of view or how I approach a situation? If these requirements are met I include the work here.

Many of these are books you’ve likely heard of before, and for good reason. I’m not trying to bring some treatise on a niche subject like oranges into the public consciousness (although it [exists](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54983) and I’ve heard great things). A good book should be accessible and understandable, an influential book even more so.

# Into The Wild - Jon Krakauer

![Untitled](Reading%20List%20a38a9c1e9f8b402b8e60f344454082be/Untitled.png)

### What’s it about?

20-year old Christopher McCandless, top of his class at Emory, abandons his possessions and hitchhikes across the country. Within two years his body was found by moose hunters in the Alaskan wilderness. This book follows an investigative reporter as he tries to trace McCandless’ steps and understand his motivations.

### Why should I read it?

It’s rare for me to meet a 20-something man who has not thought about leaving it all behind. This book follows what happened when someone actually did, and frankly did it quite well all the way until the end. If nothing else, the book is worth reading to indulge yourself an answer to that nagging question *****************What if I just packed up and left?*****************

This book collects McCandless’ books, journals, and interactions with others. It builds a reflection of an intensely intelligent, idealistic, headstrong and complex young man; it explores his philosophy and what drove him to leave his life behind.

You get the sense you’re peeking in on someone who was bold enough to step outside of the guardrails that exist around most of us from the moment we are born and carve out the life he wanted to live. It feels a privilege to listen in on his thoughts and you hope to pluck tidbits of advice off them - enough to change the way you look at things, enough to push you to take that frightening next step out of your comfortable life, but not so much you end up dead in a ditch.

There are a collection of beautiful stories in this book on the relationships McCandless formed with people while traveling the country. He was only with any of these people a few months at most, but his presence lingers with them for much, much longer. From the interviews with these people we get snapshots of raw relationships in little pockets of Americana - so far on the fringe of society you feel you peek back in time - and the relationships feel that much more special, unsullied, unbothered by the world around them.

# Hyperion - Dan Simmons

![Untitled](Reading%20List%20a38a9c1e9f8b402b8e60f344454082be/Untitled%201.png)

### What’s it about?

On the eve of Armageddon, seven pilgrims set off to the planet Hyperion, a backwater realm where alien artifacts move backwards through time and a killing machine haunts the valley of time.

### Why should I read it?

Hyperion is a titan of science fiction. While it builds on *****many***** previously explored sci-fi tropes - space opera, AI, dystopia, religion, consciousness - it executes them all in such a coherent and natural way I have not seen replicated in other works (which is remarkable given the *****scale***** of the universe built inside). Many sci-fi novels get so deep in the ********science******** portion they lose the *******fiction******* bit of the novel - the work feels dense and the plot muddy. Hyperion understands the first and only obligation of the writer is to the story, and keeps it progressing.

Hyperion has a unique narrative structure based on The Canterbury Tales. The book is divided into a story for each pilgrim - the poet’s story, the scholar’s story. So while there is a main storyline that progresses between each tale, the tales provide depth and context to the universe. The tales develop each character. The tales are seamlessly interwoven with the main storyline, and later stories end up interweaving with earlier stories as well. The reader enjoys all the variety and story of an anthology along with the satisfaction of a coherent main storyline.

The universe is rich (there are four books!). It portrays humanity projected 100 years in the future on it’s current trajectory across a score of planets, and is able to pinpoint those little details that make it feel so alive and realistic. The poet has an editor who adopts a different galactic fashion each week. The detective has a Cantonese restaurant she prefers on her home world. 

Hyperion itself is a beautiful world, with endless seas of grass and lost cities of artists and uncontacted tribes hidden in the mountains. There are alien tombs scattered on the planet, a cult dedicated to a ghost story, parasites that make the host immortal. The story makes you dream, and is well worth reading.

# Calvin and Hobbes - Bill Watterson

![Untitled](Reading%20List%20a38a9c1e9f8b402b8e60f344454082be/Untitled%202.png)

### What’s it about?

A boy and his stuffed tiger :)

### Why should I read it?

Who doesn’t love Calvin and Hobbes? These are the comics many of us grew up on. Going back to reread them as an adult brought me joy, and deepened my appreciation for Bill Watterson. He has not forgotten what it’s like to be a little boy and does an excellent job of showing the world from a child’s eyes. You find yourself remembering the little worlds you built for yourself as a kid, how walking the woods felt like a great adventure, how your sandbox turned into a desert on an alien planet and summer vacation was one great long contented sigh under a tree.

Calvin and Hobbes is a time machine, a lazy Sunday cartoon, a way to refresh and comfort yourself after battling with adult responsibilities.
